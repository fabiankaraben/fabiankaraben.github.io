With every new release, Java introduces better ways to solve problems. However, many codebases still rely on outdated approaches. From `java.util.Date` to the old IO API, this post aims to identify obsolete Java features and provide you with their modern, more efficient alternatives.

Example content snippet to be expanded on later:
- Replace `java.util.Date` with the modern `java.time` API.
- Use `Streams` instead of complex `for` loops for data processing.
- Switch from `Vector` or `Hashtable` to modern Collections like `ArrayList` and `ConcurrentHashMap`.
