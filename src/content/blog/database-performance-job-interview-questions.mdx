A slick UI and a powerful backend mean nothing if your application is stuck waiting for the database. When response times lag and users get frustrated, all eyes turn to the data layer. A slow database can bring even the most well-architected application to its knees. That's why companies are searching for engineers who can do more than just write `SELECT * FROM users`. They need experts who can diagnose performance issues, optimize queries, and design a scalable data infrastructure.

This guide zooms in on the critical topic of database performance. We’ve compiled 50 common interview questions covering query optimization, advanced indexing, connection pooling, and read replicas. If you want to prove you have what it takes to build fast, scalable, and resilient systems, this is for you.

## Query Optimization: Writing Smarter, Not Harder

It all starts with the query. A poorly written query can bring a server to a halt, while a well-optimized one can run in milliseconds.

**1. What is a query execution plan?**
A query execution plan (or explain plan) is the sequence of steps the database's query optimizer decides to use to access data for a SQL statement. It shows how the database will join tables, what indexes it will use, and the estimated cost of each operation.

**2. How do you view the execution plan for a query?**
You use the `EXPLAIN` (or `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` in PostgreSQL) command. For example: `EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM customers WHERE city = 'New York';`.

**3. What is a "full table scan"? Why is it often bad for performance?**
A full table scan is when the database reads every single row in a table to find the ones that match the query's `WHERE` clause. It's often bad for performance because it's I/O-intensive and slow, especially on large tables. The goal is usually to use an index to avoid this.

**4. What is a "SARGable" query?**
SARGable (Search-Argument-able) refers to a condition in a `WHERE` clause that can use an index to speed up the search. Non-SARGable predicates, like applying a function to an indexed column (e.g., `WHERE YEAR(order_date) = 2025`), prevent the optimizer from using the index effectively.

**5. How can you rewrite `WHERE YEAR(order_date) = 2025` to be SARGable?**
You can rewrite it as a range query on the column itself: `WHERE order_date >= '2025-01-01' AND order_date < '2026-01-01'`. This allows the database to use an index on `order_date`.

**6. Why is `SELECT *` considered a performance anti-pattern?**
`SELECT *` retrieves all columns from a table, which can lead to unnecessary I/O and network traffic, especially if you only need a few columns. It's better to explicitly list the columns you need. This also helps create covering indexes.

**7. How can subqueries in the `WHERE` clause hurt performance?**
Correlated subqueries, which execute once for each row of the outer query, can be very inefficient. It's often better to rewrite them as a `JOIN`.

**8. What does "cardinality" mean in the context of a database index?**
Cardinality refers to the uniqueness of data values in a column. A column with high cardinality (like a `user_id`) has many unique values and is a good candidate for an index. A column with low cardinality (like a `gender` column with only a few distinct values) is a poor candidate.

**9. When might a `FULLTEXT` index be more appropriate than a `LIKE` query with wildcards?**
For searching within text fields, a `LIKE '%search_term%'` query is very inefficient as it can't use a standard B-Tree index. A `FULLTEXT` index is specifically designed for fast and relevant searching of natural language text.

**10. What is the N+1 query problem?**
The N+1 problem occurs when an application makes one initial query to retrieve a list of items (the "1") and then makes N subsequent queries to fetch related data for each of those items. It's common in ORMs and can be solved by "eager loading" the related data in the initial query, typically with a `JOIN`.

**11. How can `UNION ALL` be faster than `UNION`?**
`UNION` combines the results of two queries and removes duplicate rows. `UNION ALL` combines the results but does *not* remove duplicates. The process of finding and removing duplicates requires a sort or hash operation, making `UNION` slower. Use `UNION ALL` if you know there are no duplicates or if they are acceptable.

**12. What are Common Table Expressions (CTEs), and how can they improve a query?**
A CTE (defined with the `WITH` clause) creates a temporary, named result set that you can reference within a `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` statement. They improve readability and can help break down complex logic, sometimes allowing the optimizer to generate a better plan than nested subqueries.

## Advanced Indexing: The Ultimate Speed Boost

You know what an index is. Now let's go deeper. Advanced indexing strategies separate the pros from the amateurs.

**13. What is a composite (or multi-column) index?**
A composite index is an index on two or more columns. The order of the columns in the index is crucial, as it determines how the index can be used.

**14. Why does the order of columns matter in a composite index?**
The database can use a composite index on `(col_a, col_b)` for queries that filter on `col_a` or on both `col_a` and `col_b`. However, it generally cannot use the index to search for `col_b` by itself. The columns should be ordered from most selective (highest cardinality) to least selective.

**15. What is a covering index?**
A covering index is an index that includes all the columns required to answer a query. When a query is "covered" by an index, the database can answer it by reading only the index, without having to access the table data itself. This is called an "index-only scan" and is extremely fast.

**16. When would you use a partial index?**
A partial index is an index built over a subset of a table's rows. You define it with a `WHERE` clause. This is useful for indexing a common subset of data (e.g., `WHERE paid = false`) while keeping the index small and efficient.

**17. What is an expression index (or function-based index)?**
An expression index is an index built on a function or expression involving one or more columns. For example, you could create an index on `LOWER(email)` to support case-insensitive email lookups efficiently.

**18. What is index fragmentation, and how do you fix it?**
Fragmentation occurs when the logical ordering of pages in an index doesn't match the physical ordering on disk, or when there is a lot of empty space on index pages. It happens over time due to `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` operations. It can be fixed by **rebuilding** or **reorganizing** the index.

**19. When would you *not* want to add an index to a table?**
You might avoid adding an index on:
* Tables with very high write (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) and low read frequency.
* Very small tables where a full table scan is already fast.
* Columns with very low cardinality.

**20. What is an index "fill factor"?**
The fill factor is a setting that determines how full the database should make each leaf-level page of an index when it's created or rebuilt. A fill factor of less than 100% leaves empty space on pages to reduce page splits as new data is added, which can improve write performance.

**21. Explain the difference between a B-Tree index and a Hash index.**
* **B-Tree Index**: The default for most databases. It stores data in a sorted tree structure, making it efficient for both exact matches and range queries (e.g., `>`,`<`, `BETWEEN`).
* **Hash Index**: Stores a hash value of the column. It's extremely fast for exact equality lookups (`=`) but cannot be used for range queries.

**22. How can an unused index hurt performance?**
Even if an index is never used for reading, it must still be updated every time a row is inserted, updated, or deleted in the table. This adds unnecessary overhead to all write operations.

**23. What is an index-organized table (IOT)?**
In an IOT, the data for the table is stored within the B-Tree structure of the primary key index itself. There is no separate table storage. This can be very fast for primary key lookups but may be slower for queries that require a second index.

**24. How does adding a `NULL`-able column to an index affect it?**
Most database systems can store `NULL` values in an index. How they are treated can vary. Often, an index on a single `NULL`-able column won't be used for queries like `WHERE my_col IS NULL` unless specifically designed to.

## Connection Pooling: Managing Your Resources

Every database connection consumes resources. Connection pooling is a vital technique for managing them efficiently in a high-traffic application.

**25. What is connection pooling?**
Connection pooling is the practice of creating and maintaining a cache of database connections that can be reused for future requests. Instead of opening and closing a connection for every request, the application borrows a connection from the pool and returns it when finished.

**26. Why is connection pooling important for performance?**
Opening a database connection is an expensive operation. It involves network latency, authentication, and memory allocation on the database server. Connection pooling avoids this overhead for every request, significantly improving application performance and scalability.

**27. Where is the connection pool typically managed?**
The connection pool is managed on the **application side**, either directly within the application's code or by an application server. It is not a feature of the database itself.

**28. What are some key configuration parameters for a connection pool?**
* **Minimum Pool Size**: The number of connections to keep open at all times.
* **Maximum Pool Size**: The maximum number of connections the pool can create.
* **Connection Timeout**: The time an application will wait for a connection if the pool is empty.
* **Idle Timeout**: The time a connection can remain idle in the pool before being closed.

**29. What happens if a request needs a connection and the pool has reached its maximum size?**
The request will be queued and will wait for a connection to be returned to the pool. If no connection becomes available before the "connection timeout" period expires, the request will fail, usually with an exception.

**30. What is a "connection leak"?**
A connection leak occurs when an application borrows a connection from the pool but fails to return it (e.g., due to an unhandled exception). This slowly depletes the available connections in the pool, eventually causing the application to hang or fail.

**31. How can you test if a connection from the pool is still valid before using it?**
Most connection pooling libraries have a "test on borrow" or "validation query" feature. When an application requests a connection, the pool first runs a simple, fast query (e.g., `SELECT 1`) to ensure the connection is still alive before handing it over.

**32. What is the difference between connection pooling and persistent connections?**
Persistent connections are a simpler concept where a connection is kept open after a script finishes in case another script needs it. Connection pooling is a more robust, client-side management system that handles a cache of multiple connections, including logic for timeouts, validation, and sizing.

**33. Does connection pooling reduce the number of connections on the database server itself?**
Not necessarily. It limits the number of *concurrent* connections from a single application instance to the configured maximum pool size. The main goal is to reduce the *rate* of new connection creation (churn), not necessarily the total number of open connections.

**34. What is "statement caching" or "prepared statement pooling"?**
This is a feature often combined with connection pooling. It caches `PreparedStatement` objects. Since parsing SQL is a non-trivial CPU task for the database, reusing already-parsed statements for queries that are run frequently can provide an additional performance boost.

**35. How does a microservices architecture affect connection pooling strategy?**
In a microservices architecture, each service instance will typically have its own connection pool. This can lead to a very high number of total connections to the database. It becomes crucial to size each pool carefully and monitor the total connections on the database server to avoid exhausting its resources.

**36. Can the database close a connection that a pool thinks is open?**
Yes. A database server might close a connection due to its own idle timeout settings, or a firewall between the application and the database might drop the connection. This is why connection validation is so important.

## Read Replicas: Scaling Your Reads

When one database server can't handle the load, you need to scale. Read replicas are a fundamental pattern for scaling read-heavy workloads.

**37. What is a read replica?**
A read replica is a live, read-only copy of a primary (master) database. The primary database handles all write operations (`INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`), and these changes are then asynchronously or synchronously replicated to one or more replicas.

**38. What is the primary use case for read replicas?**
The primary use case is **scaling read traffic**. Applications can direct their read-heavy queries (e.g., reporting, analytics, public-facing content) to the replicas, freeing up the primary database to handle critical write operations.

**39. What is "replication lag"?**
Replication lag is the delay between when a write occurs on the primary database and when that change is visible on a read replica. Since most replication is asynchronous, a small delay is normal.

**40. How can replication lag affect an application?**
It can lead to stale data reads. For example, a user updates their profile picture (a write to the primary) and is immediately redirected to their profile page (a read from a replica). If the replication lag is high, they might still see their old picture.

**41. How can you handle situations where you need to read your own writes immediately?**
A common pattern is to direct any reads that must be up-to-date (like the example above) directly to the **primary** database for a short period after a write. All other reads can go to the replicas.

**42. What happens if the primary database fails?**
In a high-availability (HA) setup, a read replica can be **promoted** to become the new primary database. This failover process can be manual or automated.

**43. Explain the difference between synchronous and asynchronous replication.**
* **Asynchronous Replication (Most Common)**: The primary commits the transaction and responds to the client immediately. The changes are sent to the replica in the background. It's fast but allows for replication lag.
* **Synchronous Replication**: The primary waits for at least one replica to confirm it has received and applied the change before committing and responding to the client. It guarantees no data loss on failover but adds latency to write operations.

**44. Can you have more than one read replica?**
Yes, you can have many read replicas connected to a single primary database, allowing you to scale reads horizontally. You can even have replicas of replicas.

**45. Besides scaling, what is another use case for a read replica?**
Running long-running, resource-intensive operations like data analytics or backups. By running these tasks on a replica, you avoid impacting the performance of the primary production database.

**46. What is "read/write splitting"?**
This is the practice of routing all SQL write statements to the primary database and all read statements to one or more read replicas. This is typically handled at the application level, either in the code or via a proxy.

**47. What challenges does read/write splitting introduce?**
The main challenge is managing data consistency due to replication lag. The application logic must be aware that reads from a replica might not reflect the absolute latest writes.

**48. What is a multi-master replication setup?**
In a multi-master (or active-active) setup, two or more databases can accept write operations. This is more complex than a primary-replica setup as it requires conflict resolution mechanisms to handle cases where the same data is changed in multiple locations simultaneously.

**49. How does a load balancer work with read replicas?**
An application can send its read queries to a single load balancer endpoint. The load balancer then distributes those queries across the pool of available read replicas using a strategy like round-robin, spreading the read load evenly.

**50. What metrics should you monitor for a replicated setup?**
* **Replication Lag**: The most critical metric.
* **CPU/Memory/I/O Usage**: On both the primary and all replicas.
* **Network Throughput**: Between the primary and replicas.
* **Transaction Throughput**: On both read and write nodes.
